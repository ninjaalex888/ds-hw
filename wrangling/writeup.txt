For part 1 on computing the District Margins. 

I at first tried to solve each function as they appeared in the file but then looked at main() and solved them middle, bottom, top. It took me a little bit to re-familiarize myself with python. Good thing it is a pretty high level language and relatively straight forward. After coming back to part 1 after a day I realized it wasn't fully working even though it was passing the tests. I wasn't thinking through the logic of looping well. I found it really difficult to conform to the exact specifications of the other functions and the prewritten code threw me off a lot and I would've preffered to start from scratch in my opinion. This assingment took me a long time even though I'm pretty comfortable with programming. But I will be faster for next time as I know what to expect. External resources I used was Google, for the times I was unsure or needing reminding on how to do certain things. It would normally direct me over to a StackOverflow question related to what I was asking. I didn't really look at the results much, but it's interesting to see top words from the State of the Union addresses as well as where the most competitve districts are in the US. It will be cool to start working with the data we extracted in future homeworks.
